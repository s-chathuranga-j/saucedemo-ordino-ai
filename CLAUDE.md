# Ordino Rules

Ordino handles Playwright test automation (writing, adding, fixing, stabilizing, refactoring, running,
and auditing tests; scaffolding; CI). When the user asks for any of that, use the Ordino skill and
tools. For general coding, documentation, or questions, work directly — do not call Ordino tools.

## Start here
- For any test-automation task, call `ordino_workflow` first. Mandatory phase steps are in each response's `phase_instructions`. Follow `progress_display.instruction` exactly (server detects MCP App panel support).
- **Stateless progress:** pass `path` once started; on each phase change pass `node`, `from`, and `completed` (node ids fully done). **Copy `progress_echo` from every response into the next call** — there is no job id.
- Follow `agent_directives.next_when_ready` when a phase done-conditions are met. Do not skip phases or their done-conditions.
- Read `.ordino/rules.md` first if it exists — project-specific overrides there take precedence over
  everything below.
- Never delete or overwrite anything under the `.ordino/` folder.

## Selectors — never guess
- Never invent or guess a selector. Ground every locator with `browser_read` against the live page (or
  an existing recording).
- XPath-first. Use `getByRole` only when XPath is genuinely unreachable, and say why. No CSS, no
  `getByLabel/Placeholder/Text/TestId/Title`, no `.or()/.filter()/.first()/.nth()/.last()`. One match
  only (uniqueness == 1).

## Code structure
- Tests live only in `tests/<feature>.spec.ts`; page objects in `pages/`, panels in `panels/`. Never create
  `src/ features/ e2e/ specs/ __tests__/`.
- All source is `.ts` — never `.js/.jsx/.mjs/.cjs`.
- 7-token naming: the same noun across the story, `support/data/<x>/`, `<X>Page`, the fixture `<x>Page`,
  `<x>Expected`, `tests/<x>.spec.ts`, and the `describe` title.

## Codegen vs direct edit (files are the source of truth)
- New feature → `ordino_generate_code` mode `create` — it wires page objects, the barrel
  (`page-loader.ts`), config (`page.config.ts`), the spec, and `expected.json`. Once per feature —
  never re-run `create` on an existing feature; it regenerates and clobbers hand edits.
- New page in an existing feature → `register_page`. New `test()` in an existing spec →
  `add_test_cases`.
- Every other change (locators, steps, assertions, deletes, refactors) → edit the `.ts` files directly,
  following the conventions. `npm run audit` (tsc) is the real gate.

## Story traceability
- Stories use stable keys: `AC-<n>:` under `# Acceptance Criteria`; scenario headings end with the tag,
  e.g. `## Happy Path [AC-1]`.
- Every spec starts with `// spec: .ordino/stories/<feature>.story.md`.
- Every test has `// scenario: <name>` before it, and a title starting with exactly one `[AC-n]` tag
  that exists in the linked story. If a traceability field is missing or invalid, fix it before
  finishing.

## Secrets
- `.env` is the only secret source; reference via `process.env.X!`. Never bake a credential into a
  `fill`/`select` value or into `expected.json`.

## Communication
- Speak plain language — what you found, what you did, what's next — with light progress markers
  (🔍 📝 ▶️ 🩹 ✅).
- Don't expose internal terms (node names, "graph", "MCP", "workflow", node IDs) to the user.
